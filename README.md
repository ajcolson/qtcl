# qtcl

The Quick Text Command Language (QTCL) is a simple, text based interpreted language. The primary goal is to provide plaintext files with a small amount of programmable outputs from templates. The language is designed with the mindset of keeping the feature set minimal but robust and having a low barrier to understanding and use.

This repository is for the command line utility called “qtcl“ written by Alex Colson using .NET/C#. Currently this program is only available for Windows, but cross platform support is planned. The program implements what should be considered the standard library for QTCL templates.
